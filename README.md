# E-Kharid-Automated
This GitHub repository contains the automation software code that helps print hard copies of the J-Form available on Ekharid's website. The code is written in Python language and Selenium library is majorly used.

# Working
You need to pass the mobile number of the farmer in the number variable and the further work program will do itself.
Note: You must also select either to print or cancel the selected Jform.
